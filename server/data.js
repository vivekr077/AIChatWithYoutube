      "Lando Norris wins the Hungarian Grand Prix by 610 of a second. Lovely. Do you think Oscar is thinking that's one that got away? Equally, do you think Lando is thinking I stole that one? Pastry going late, locking up and he avoids his teammate. That was a little bit over the edge. Lando, our winner, has just joined us. Did you roll off the brakes to stop Oscar hitting you? I must have. I put a little squirt on the throttle. For Gabby to be able to delivering the kind of race that he was able to deliver here at the the hunger ring was great to see. You just have to listen to me. I would have found a different way of managing those issues. Did Ferrari get the strategy wrong with me? Maybe. What happened? I'm just useless. I've never heard him talk himself down to that extent. People in the pedock, they they worry about Lewis. He has a 100% contract for next year. But h [Music] McLaren versus Ferrari, Pastri versus Norris. The Hungarian Grand Prix was decided by some gripping strategy battles and a tense duel on track in the closing laps. Welcome everyone to F1 Nation. I'm Tom Clarkson and joining me in the Budapest paddock is the most successful driver in Lore history, Tom Christensen and Fox Sports Mexico's Diego Mayer. Guys, what a race. What a weekend, TK. It was a stunning jewel at the front, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. I mean, it it it has been a stunning I mean Hungary just never disappoints. It always throws up some suspense. Look at the qualifying yesterday. Just in the middle of it, it starts to get cooler. the wind come up and suddenly poof, you had a you had a Ferrari on pole. Tom makes a good point there, Diego, about the closeness of it all. I mean, top 10 yesterday, separated by just half a second, and this was this was the closest uh winning margin in a green race that we've had all year. Yeah, absolutely. It was it was a fantastic weekend. uh coming from qualifying uh the drivers having to improvise with this changing conditions in the wind even within Q3 changing direction and uh Charles delivering this surprising pole the contrast with the crisis Louis is going through on the other side of the garage and then this Grand Prix that delivered I think the best fight we've seen so far between Lando and Oscar and hopefully the first of many that we see in the last 10 races. It was it was the tensest battle we've had between the two McLaren drivers, wasn't it? Yeah. And a little bit I mean going right till the very end if we start there when Oscar launched it on the penultimate lap. I mean that was uh that was a little bit over the edge again a little bit similar of course in Austria but this was even a little bit worse because for me it was not on and that was a little bit surprising seeing how decisive he has been in in his overtakes when you look his career in Formula 1. They have always been splended the way he put it in but this time he was a little bit little bit ambitious with that sense. Diego, how did Lando Norris's one-stop strategy beat Oscar Pastri on a two? Wow. I think there was no other way for Lando to win the race basically. So, I think from that point of view, he had to try it because otherwise he was going to finish behind his his teammate and he was going to lose margins. So, at that point, I mean, we saw from very early with with Fernando especially that there were some drivers keen on trying the one stop. I think Fernando's space indicated that from very early on and then the radio starting to come up with Oscar also being asked about the possibility of making it work. So I mean as Slando himself said on the radio I mean let let's give it a try. He went for it and and he delivered. He knew it was going to be difficult in the end. He also preserved the one two for the team cuz he had he not left the space when Oscar did this launches uh twice in the closing laps maybe they there would have been some contact I don't know if the kind of contact to get both of them out of the one two but uh yeah it would have been very difficult to avoid contact you know Lando said something I thought very interesting after the race in the press conference he said he didn't doubt doubt that he could make the tire last, the Grand Prix. He did 39 laps on that one set and yet he said even at the beginning of that stint, he didn't doubt it. That's when you see his experience come to front. For some time, we've had the at at least I thought that Lando had better ultimate speed than Oscar, but this year I don't think so. I mean, especially the last few races we've seen Oscar the way he dominated at Spa. I asked the other day Andreas Stella what has improved the most on on Oscar's side since he claimed his first win a year ago here and he said speed and that has improved everything else with it. The experience obviously gives you more perspective in certain decisions. You know more about what you can do with certain aspects and he had to play you know but uh yeah it seemed like he had the uh conviction that that he could make it work. It was tight, but he made it work. And the other thing is whenever you saw the onboards of Oscar getting close to the car ahead on the last corner, he had a few nice over steer moments. And when it's the same car you're racing against, I guess it's more difficult racing a Ferrari. Maybe the cars have different traits, but when you're racing your teammate, he had the same tools. Maybe yeah, different age on the tires at that point, but it was clear that it was not easy to do that last turn as close as he needed to be able to get a proper attempt. The layout of the Hungaro ring favors the person in front, doesn't it? Because the pit straight is the one overtaking point and you've got two 180° corners leading onto the pit straight, right? So, it's difficult to stay close. Yeah, there's no doubt. So, uh, you really have to to do well and you need a big upset in the terms of the tires like Diego touches on. But I I I think just you what fascinates me as well is the is the dialogue with the engineers. You can you can feel there's more intensity on both Oscar and and Lando speaking to to to Tom and uh and Will as the lead engineers on both cars. And you think also I mean sack you say they are free to race also engineers they are free to do whatever they do to make the best for for from for McLaren and this intensity goes probably into and I'm sure they will reflect on that during the summer break here. They're way ahead in the constructors the championship it's between those two and it's a golden opportunity because you don't know what you're going to have in 2026. So to have a world championship that that that that is going to to be an interesting very interesting in team battle. Yeah. And I would like to say also that a year ago we were questioning those papaya rules because of how the race unfolded here between Oscar and Lando that they had to somehow undercut Oscar with Lando because Lewis beat before and then they had to ask them to swap positions. Lando did it in the end. Looked like he didn't want to, but he did it with three laps to go. And it didn't look like the Papaya rules would be up for a fight between two McLaren drivers. But a year on, I like what they've done. I mean, I I had my doubts that they would leave their sides of the garage, have their own strategy and battle with strategy amongst them, but they they're up for it. I mean, they have the gap now. Max is almost 100 points behind in the championship. and the constructors they may well seal that by Baku Singapore. So I like what what I see with the Papaya rules and how they are working in this interesting battle. Do you think Oscar is thinking that's one that got away equally? Do you think Lando if he's being really honest with himself when he's looking in the mirror is thinking I stole that one? Yeah, in a way surely one one is uh one is right under the gearbox of Shallair the leading Ferrari. The other one is down in fifth and then these strategies sometimes come in handy like we just just explained. Silverstone he had it all. Spa he did really well but then again here it's a small dip. So it's it's you're smiling. There is nothing to choose. What do we got? Nine points between the two McLaren drivers. is I feel as we go into the summer break that might as well be zero. It's going to be fascinating h how this all pans out. Tom, there's one more thought I want to pick your brain about and that is something Andrea Stella said in the press conference on Friday. He believes that the relationship between these two these two drivers is better now than it was a couple of years ago. And yet now is when it really matters because the world championships at stake. I find that fascinating. I find the psychology behind that fascinating. There's no doubt there's a very good people within McLaren having a lot of empathy in that way that they are making sure everything is u is on the table. Obviously when they are racing we can see very easily that uh they are doing whatever they can and whatever they should do at uh really trying to win. And uh for sure you have already seen in Canada uh you know you nearly saw a little bit in Austria we you saw it again here they go all in uh in direct fight and trusting their own instincts but uh fireworks are coming there's no doubt but I have uh like Diego touched on before I have almost respect of the way the the management are dealing with the drivers because they're quite close in and yeah Lando a little bit older a little bit more exper experienced of course but uh they they are quite near and they know this is the golden opportunity. One of them will be world champion and it might not be that McLaren have the best car in 2026. So it is going to be nailbiting and there will be fireworks but the question about how they are behaving I take my hat off. They are both um cool guys who are they are both welcome at my at my Christmas dinner. Can we come Is it a case of keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer? But it's not about friendship. It's about respecting each other. They're respecting. They're racing each other hard. But as long as they can look at them straight in the eye and discuss these things after what they I'm sure they are doing that clearly otherwise um and that's done way before the papaya but they're doing it every time because of course you have fractions of when they overdoing it just today. I mean, uh, Oscar nearly on these two laps, he nearly, uh, nearly overdid it, and I think there was a little bit of help on the second one from Lando, actually, uh, knowing that he he would, uh, he would have a go as they were running out of laps. We're in the McLaren Moto and Lando, our winner, has just joined us. Did you roll off the brakes to stop Oscar hitting you? That's been our question. I must have. I put a little squirt on the sod. I don't I don't actually know because you do it all it's all instincts then you know I probably I mean I was watching my mirror so I probably had a little like a little off the break and back on I'd have to check I don't I don't actually know the answer so I know it's been such a good weekend you're on a high you're staying for the test ar you yeah I just I just don't want to leave so I wanted to go and do another test on Tuesday so yeah no bit bit more work to do before uh before the break yeah well done from all of us thank you Lando thank you for obviously going to turn one, land on knew exactly where Oscar was and and and probably realized there's a move coming. There was a pen on a lap. So, he knew that it was going to come and uh he was watching the mirrors as he said. So, instinctively, you probably do a little bit of modulating of the brakes at the very end. I mean, trail braking there uh just to make sure that both cars were were leaving turn one again. Definitely it uh it got close and uh instinctively when you see a little bit of smoke you you know that the guy behind comes faster than it should. It must be a hard thing as well. You're you're in the title fight of your life and he's staying in Hungary to do a 2026 tire test. Do you think his brain is worried about 2026 right now? Oh no. Oh no. Yeah. As much as they say that they want to preserve, you know, this uh feeling within the team and hopefully make this a trend that McLaren dominates F1 for for many years. Yeah, the focus remains on what's going on this year. I mean, any laps, I guess Tom would know better, but any laps that a driver can do are helpful. He's he's building, you know, team building in some way an extra effort before he goes on holiday. But yeah, I think it it's good. And and touching back on on what uh Tom was saying, I asked Lando in the TV pen whether he would have tried that same move that that Oscar tried on him twice at the end of the of the straight and he said, \"Yeah, I mean, you rather tried and leave the the track when you know that the the victory was was there for you to take.\" TK, you have driven the TPC car for McLaren. Yeah. So, I I'm a little bit disappointed that they didn't ask me to do to do the 2026 tire test here, but uh ah they might have forgot about me. How do you find these cars? Are they I drove the TPC car last year at actually by invitation of Sack Brown. So, it was a big great opportunity but and he made sure there was a sufficient circuit for me. So in the beginning I thought it was going to be silverstone uh but it was red bull ring and as you know sector two and three there are pretty fast. So, uh, I realized there that, uh, I'm not fit enough anymore by, uh, by age of these wonderful cars. Seamless in terms of the gearbox is unbelievable. You don't lose any speed in changing. Just go through the gears, the brakes. The car is not pulling anywhere. Is giving very good feedback. So, everything comes sort of easy to the point that actually they say, \"Thank you very much. That's it. The 10 laps are done, Tom.\" But that happened really fast and I I enjoyed it. But they are they are very physical. Particularly turn nine. That was where I had the biggest offset to Lando and and and Oscar. I had the whole thing in the sim month before. That's the penultimate corner. That's the penultimate corner over the crest. I think the whole flesh of my body was at the left side of the monok through there. That was the feeling I had. And I was I was still losing a few tents. But um of course the ground effect, the downforce, the power in braking and accelerating and cornering. Yeah, very very impressive and it have helped me a lot now to communicate the the feeling of these great athletes uh what they achieving, what they are doing. This episode is sponsored by Indeed.

[Music] Now after leading the way from pole position, Charllair finished P4 more than 30 seconds behind the McLarens. Charles said in the media pen afterwards that he started to lose performance from around lap 40, just over half distance, due to a problem with the chassis, and I'm using quote marks on team radio. During the race, he wasn't happy with Ferrari's strategy, saying, \"We're going to lose this race after the first stop.\" And then after being overtaken by Pestri, he said, \"You just have to listen to me. I would have found a different way of managing those issues.\" So, first, did Ferrari get the strategy wrong with Llair? Yeah, maybe they did. But ultimately, the strategy with the problem they apparently had was going to be second in the order of causes for not delivering the result. I guess the real issue was more to do with why did they lose so much space in from that lap 40 that you just mentioned cuz it was very clear that that was no more the llur that we saw end of uh pestri at the beginning of the race or there there was a real issue and he had nothing I mean strategy could have helped a little bit but it wouldn't has have saved his race I think I don't want to focus on the negatives of Ferrari I I I think there are so many positives to talk about. I mean, you know, that pole position lap by Charlotte yesterday was was stunning. Nothing less than stunning. Absolutely. And that I mean, we know how fast Charlotte is over one lap. I mean, he he's absolutely maybe the best over one lap. I mean here we have seen that so often in the fight against Max Fabin earlier but bringing it up there that bring brought a lot of smile smiles on the faces at Ferrari and and they they were very optimistic going into the race starting in front he executed a very good first lap. He was leading uh both on the medium tires then on the the the hard tire and then when he got into the second stop a little bit probably a little bit early probably a little bit to to protect him from Oscar I think on lap 40 or 41 and then he got a second set of heart and then he faded after there. So for me it's a temperature issue on this or something uh I I I could imagine uh which got seems to get worse and a temperature likely which goes to the brakes or eventually on the tires of course but it's they are very close on that of course and uh they will go to sort that out but it's fascinating to hear that it's something they discussed beforehand they were not completely agreeing and um yeah Fred Rosan couldn't couldn't give us more uh thought on that. But um it will be it will be solved before they go to Sunford. There's no doubt about that. I mean another positive for Ferrari is that L. Clerk was saying before the weekend statistically this is my worst track of the season. I've never had a decent result here. And then he goes and puts it on pole position and actually outperforms the Hungaro Ring specialist that is Lewis Hamilton in in the same car. Yeah, you touched on that and and that's um I mean everyone wants him to to come back to winning ways, Lewis Hamilton with Ferrari, but he he he's struggling and he's was very hard on himself, but yes, he had a his home high race at Silverstone didn't go to plan. I mean, his season is it's tough for him and then he goes to a circuit where he has eight wins, nine polls, and if he's not winning, he's definitely always on the podium like last year. So, it must be really hard. And to see Louis lining up after the race uh in a queue at at the Joe Ba when he has to get weight, he he kept his helmet on. There was five or six drivers in front of him who had to get weight before. I think he takes it takes it hard on himself and he's it's tough to to see. Yeah, maybe involuntarily the this new suspension is giving more SH what he needs and less Louis. Not by design necessarily, but Louis has not spoken positively about this new suspension during the weekend. But um yeah, it's hard. I mean, it's the first time that Louis was not in Q3 here. The only time he had not been was 2014 when the car caught fire. Every time he had been in Q3 here, it's it's hard to see Louis struggling so much. I don't think he has certainly forgotten how to do things around this place or any place. But clearly this car is not is not suiting his style and he's not finding any answers as to how to get the speed that Charlotte is able to deliver. What I don't like seeing is Lewis so so hard on himself to come out in after qualifying and say Ferrari need to get a new driver. I mean he's a very emotional driver. We've seen that. That's been a consistent thing throughout Lewis's career, but I've never in all these years since 2007 heard him talk talk himself down to that extent. I don't know what he's trying to achieve by it other than it's a it's a an emotional reaction, but why else he's saying things like that? Yeah, me neither. Yeah, to me it just comes across as his pure emotions, his frustration at not having really any answers because when your teammate is on pole and you're out in Q2 and they have brought a new part to the car that should deliver, what else what else can you say? I mean, he's being fair to the team because I think they're they're trying. He's also being very clear that he's trying his best doing these documents. he's been mentioning trying to give the team all the information they can have in order to give him more of what he needs, but probably he won't get that with this car. And as Tom very well points out, uh it's going to be a reset next year. I guess Ferrari is looking forward to that reset and maybe see if next year's car is suits more. I mean, they'll have his feedback. they'll know hopefully why he struggled so much with this car or where did he struggle more and try probably to bring more of what he needs to get his speed out in 2026 but this year it's going to be difficult Tom were you a were you a documents kind of driver did you write messages to your teams yes we did uh gave some thoughts on things yes I think that's that's part of this uh dialogue building the team, the camaraderie, all these things which at the end of the day builds uh a lot of trust. So you really I mean your engineer has to be really close to you in these senses and sometimes you hear that yeah there are some discussions um with um Adami with Louis's engineer but and last year it was a little bit like yeah maybe the team is knowing I'm leaving maybe they are focusing more and that's normal but now he's very as you touched on he's really hard on himself. I have the deepest respect on people putting their hand up like that and of course a seventime world champion doing that. But on the other hand, hey, they don't race on fuel. They race on self-confidence. So to have it all there, I I think it gets a little bit under the skin on him. Unfortunately, I I want to see him do do well. And I hope he really finds his mojo. But um people in the pedock, they they worry about Louis. He has a 100% contract for next year. Ferrari wants him to do well the most, but yeah. Yeah, they're bringing in some changes. Uh there's been a new addition to his side of the garage with Luca Della who used to work on Mercedes for a long time and he's now on his side. He was I guess a performance engineer on the power unit for Louis at Mercedes. So I guess I mean it's not going to happen uh from one race to the other. Hopefully they're able to use the second part of the year to build more around the team that Lewis needs to get what he has been having in his good time at Mercedes. It's very true what uh what Tom says about these ground effect cars and there is this question of whether like it happened with Daniel Ricardo if these cars are so special and so tricky that maybe negate the ways in which certain drivers get their speed and uh the ultimate pace. But uh yeah, I would expect uh things to get a little better on on Louiswis's side. Uh hopefully he's able to close up the year in a better place than he's uh now wrapping up these first 14 races. It's hard for us to talk about that. So if I can mention just on a positive, who was last in uh in Spa, last on the grid? There's two Aston Martins, Alonso and Stroll. And where were they today? Five and seventh. So hey, it just means that it's so close as you mentioned top 10 were within uh yeah less than 610. So you you can make a difference very very fast it seems. So let's let's stay positive and all this passion that Lewis is talking with is proof that it still really matters. Oh yeah. Otherwise he wouldn't be talking like that. that that is I think the conclusion the sensible conclusion to reach and you just hope that it's not too demoralizing to come to this his racetrack and not deliver in the way that he'd hoped. Uh on on the preview the F1 Nation preview to this weekend I spoke to Valtry Botas and he said that Lewis was particularly strong. Sector 3H sector 3 the two 180° corners turns 13 and 14. He said that is where Lewis when Valtry was his teammate at Mercedes found his time. And if if Charlair walks past, I would love to ask him did did you actually look at Lewis's data? Is that what has helped turn around your performance this weekend Charl just what he's doing through because actually in qualifying on board with Lewis? He was struggling in the in the last three corner. I mean particularly the middle over steer moments through both. He was really fighting the car and I think everyone is going to benefit from Fred Vaser resigning long-term deal that was announced on the Thursday leading into this Grand Prix. That gives a bit of stability, stops the questions being asked and everyone you speak to in this paddock will say that very few team bosses in the history of the sport have got a better racing brain than Fred Vaser, right? They he knows how to empower people. He knows how to bring the collective together. And when you've got all these regulation changes coming for next year, the only thing they could do was was to resign him. [Music] Let's move on to Mercedes who had a much stronger weekend with George Russell securing his sixth podium of the season and his first since that win in Canada four races ago. He finished P3 while Kimmy Antonelli fought from P15 to P10 to score his first point since his podium in Montreal. Now guys, why were Mercedes so much more competitive this weekend than they were well the last three weekends since they won in Canada with a new suspension. Actually they of course had some belief in that but it have completely destroyed the confidence with Kim Antonelli and on Friday evening here I I I spoke to him he was incredibly happy he found again he could play with the car and he had trust in the car again and that comes from the rear suspension. Whatever they have done I I'm not sure but at least they've revert back and we have seen Mercedes doing that before. They come with an upgrade during the season, but then they have to go back. And of course, that doesn't make them close to being world champion again. Uh the car is on the edge, a little bit of a diva, but for me, the rear suspension uh for Kim Antonelli particularly made it good. George is always fast, always good, but he doesn't always get a a perfect weekend. And I think that is a little bit of that diva Mercedes, it seems, still is there a little bit. H how much of Kimmy finding finding his mojo again to quote you is down to this racetrack being so like a cart track cuz Kimmy Kimmy he's only 18. It wasn't so long ago he was driving carts. Do do you think it lends itself to carting and he it almost feels like what he grew up doing and it feels less like a Formula 1 car here and more like a go-kart. I don't know. But he certainly spoke very well about this track and his past at the Hungar ring before starting the weekend. So already he was in a very positive mood on that side. I mean he needed that because his European season by his own standards has been really bad. I mean these are this is his first point in the European season. Who would have thought? I mean his best races have come at racetracks where he had not been before. I mean his pole position for the sprint in Miami where he had not been to and suddenly he finds he finds it so difficult throughout the European season sometimes because of the car also because George is setting quite a high standard within the team and he's you know being put in to fill the shoes of a seven time world champion in Mercedes. So it's not an easy position for a rookie driver and the youngest to be in. But uh I like the fact that every time you speak to to Kimi, he always comes with a smile regardless of being it a good or a bad day and he tries to speak to you in the best possible way um is good that he leaves for this pause in the calendar with a with a a good result a solid weekend. Obviously if you look at where George was probably it was not ideal but it was it was a step towards building on having a better end of the year. And George, I mean, he said the fastest lap of the race. His pace once he got the the last set of tires was quite impressive. The temperatures came down for uh the race day relative to what we had uh especially on Friday. And that probably helped too. But uh yeah, you see George delivering whenever the car is there, he is there. And he was even quite close to P position on on Saturday. Yeah. Just a tense, wasn't it, on on Saturday. And do you think both drivers are now relaxed about next year? You know, Max Vstappen has committed to Red Bull. Do you think they're both going to sit on the beach for a couple of weeks knowing that they've at least got 2026 sorted? I think it could be the news of the summer break maybe uh that they will be um that they will be retained uh for next year. I hope so. For Mercedes and also for Kim Antonelli. I mean he's a a fantastic driver coming into Formula 1 and it's been really hard to see the struggles he have had after we really thought that he was there particularly in Miami. I mean he was the highlight of of of the Miami certainly the sprint but in the whole weekend we expected in a way it to be a formality before the festappen sort of rumor came about and that was also probably part of the reason why everything will go well when you know that you will have a a future again that might even be him a little bit more strategically about how he goes about his qualifying because the the the only thing that Antonelli did wrong was was the qualifying ing and particularly his last lap when he was just too aggressive uh over steer wheel spinning and um probably tire a little bit out of the window but the driver is part of that too but uh the rest of the weekend he did well he did a great grand prix but obviously from way too far back uh so I think he's energized by the one point he gets but um hopefully it's enough for to the wolf Mercedes to uh invest more into those two guys and I think Toto and and all the engineers can see that the gap in qualifying to George Russell is coming down. It's getting closer and and that will I think give Kimmy a lot of confidence and I think Kimmy came into this season with with a lot of hype. I was just taking a step back. I thought personally I was thinking well let's just see how it goes and I have a lot more confidence in the decision now than I had 6 months ago. I think Kimmy is worth the hype now. I've seen enough personally. Yes. Uh I I but I have doubted uh the last couple of races to to watch him in spa uh being interviewed by you and others. Uh that was uh that was hard to watch. Then you can see uh then you are fragile when you're a young man. But again just to mention I spoke to him Friday night. I saw him energized. I saw he found confidence and I think how he delivered today during the the Grand Prix his overtakings the way he placed the car. Yes, he's worth the hype, but in the meantime, no, Formula 1 is not waiting for anyone. This is an ad by Better Help. Cold plunges, morning journaling, daily walks, screen detoxes.

Gabrielle Bortalto has just had his best weekend in Formula 1. Korea driver of the day. Driver of the day on the telly. We'll come to who your driver of the day is later, TK, but you know, he he finishes a career best P6 after his best ever qualifying in P7. And actually, it's worth mentioning that a Brazilian driver has just won the Formula 3 championship as well. So, after a darth of talent, we've now got the Brazilians coming through again, haven't we, Diego? Yeah, it took like 10 years for it to come back. Since the days of Masa and Nasser, the Felipes, there was a long period in which we didn't have any any Brazilian drivers. We had Petro Fidipali come in in the house when Roman Grojan had he has his his accident, but it was uh it was for a couple of races and and now we see these two drivers who have won exactly with the same team in Formula 3 with three years separation. Rafa Kamara is uh also a Ferrari driver, academy driver. He he was helped into that by scooter from Mexico in the Latin American selection. That's how he got involved with that and he is really delivering. He's won a championship for the second year in a row because he was the Formula regional champion last year with Prema. Now we tried on his debut season. I'm sure Gabby is also very happy to see that the Brazilians are are now coming back and he himself did a did a great weekend. He was very happy. last race he also did well but in the TV pen he he seemed a little frustrated like he hadn't done the optimum that he's always searching for and cuz I asked him at the beginning of this weekend in Hungary like why aren't you so happy about you know it's a sober and you were in the points and yeah but I'm used to being on the podiums winning races now I know that that is not possible but it's still I want to do my optimum his qualifying pace is what has really stood out I think it was half a yesterday over Nika Hulenberg. Yeah, I mean I'm surprised he he's now in the on the Saturday battle. He's ahead like by two races relative to Hulk. It's strange that Nikico has qualified so far back. I think him and Stroll are the drivers who have been eliminated in Q1 the most this year, which by Hulk's standards looks uh surprising to me. So, he's maybe not being that strong on Saturdays, but we saw what he delivered on at Silverstone and other races where he has been very good on the Sunday, but Hulk is a very high standard for any driver, especially for a rookie. And for Gabby to be able to to beat him how he's doing and delivering the kind of race that he was able to deliver here at the the Hungar was was great to see his how he's progressing. And uh I'm not sure at the beginning of the year he would have thought that come this stage of the season he was going to be in such a good place with the car with the team. He has a great relationship with Hulk. Know he's happy when he does well and vice versa and that's great to see and that's only going to make the audit team of the future better. We don't know about the power unit, but we we see only positive signs from the Himil team now getting into this new era. Sorry for next year. Now, a week is a long time in Formula 1. Let's talk Aston Martin. Back row of the grid in Spar just 7 days ago. And then here we are. They have an astonishing turnaround. There's there's no other word to use. There's no doubt that uh already from free practice one I mean there was a little bit of an upset Fernando not fit. There was even a doubt that he would he make it at least that was the discussion. You have to be an athlete. You have to be uh up to your very best to to withstand this incredibly forces you get through your body. Okay. Hungary is not the most physical circuit. you just come from Spa where sector two there is is is pretty hard and probably that is also what was tearing on on on Fernando with the with the age with the with the way his body has taken that it has taken a few hits through through his career. Uh but yes it was a bit of an upset that he was not driving but then again they had they have obviously a very very good driver in Philip Dookovich and ready to to take on and speaking to the team they said the feedback they got the the the development they got with these parts going forward um was right on. So when Fernando joined in the in free practice 2 him and Stro were were right on it at that time. So they had made which I think is not a circuit uh specific update or setup. Uh it looks like it's here to stay for the rest of the year. That's at least the feedback I get from uh from the team because qualifying brilliant and the race the execution of that of both drivers were excellent. Only you can tell us about the right of these cars and how stiff they've they've been. Is that a is that an issue? Is that difficult to Yeah, you obviously you're strapped in so tight and the more the the more you're strapped in the the better it is physically. Uh lap after lap uh strain on you, the tiredness. But of course, when you're strapped in that incredibly hard as you are any any bump, any uh oscillation, it it really gets up through your spine. And that's probably also the problem on the of all the muscles uh in the lumbar area getting off course up and working hard through the neck especially at spa probably less here uh in Hungary. Yeah, it was not a word after I think even after qualifying he said that um yeah everything is good this race is not going to be an issue but of course before the weekend uh it was final team I wanted to discuss was was Red Bull Max for Stapen. Okay, he finishes P9, but he's a minute and 12 seconds behind Lando Norris, the winner. He hasn't finished on the podium in the last four races either. The pitcher, as we go into the summer break, isn't that rosy for for Red Bull? It feels Yeah, it's uh tough times. Only a week ago, we were uh speaking about his victory in the spring at Spa. I mean, everything got together and he executed a perfect short race. Had there been any strategy involved, I'm not sure he would have won the race. But yeah, this track uh last year wasn't great for them. And you could see from the very off uh of the of the weekend in first practice that they were not getting the kind of grip they expected. It was funny to hear the quotes from the drivers at the end of the of Friday. The McLaren drivers saying the track had a lot of grip and Max saying that he was sliding all over the place. Yuki is saying it's not only no grip but no balance either. So changing balance from one corner to the other. So yeah um these uh Red Bull cars for the past few years I see them a little bit as as puzzles. You know they change part one session one goes with one front wing the other side of the garage with a different one. Then they engine covers are different. Uh sometimes their rear wings are different and and sometimes they come back to the same for both cars. But uh lately Yuki has been at least one or two steps behind Max. It's very difficult and I think right now yeah you question whether they really understand what's going on with the car because everything seemed like they threw everything at it even with the Yuki starting from the pit lane. I'm sure they did some experiments. Seems like they were struggling to keep the tire in the window and that was making them. I mean you you saw Yuki try the soft tire during the race. I think it was I'm I'm not sure if he was the only one or one or one of the few, but uh there was clearly an issue in getting the tires to to work properly. Slow corners hasn't been the best uh for Red Bull in recent years and this track probably brought that up again. talking about before about McLaren, they're doing minor changes as far as I can see and that gives confidence and and you need confidence to constantly flirt on the limit and that makes the car trustworthy and fast obviously and when you constantly have to change when you're finding or changing the camber the the the toe the right height uh the weight distribution the arrow angle all when you're constantly doing that of course even even a fourtime world champion will lose a little bit of the edge in that in in these senses. I I believe I think he did a great Grand Prix again. He he is always phenomenal in in in the races, but he he didn't find the times and especially also not the durability in the race, but the overtaking, the placement and racing and also the intensity in his radio communication. He's actually a bit more calm here. You know, at one stage he was asked, \"Uh, Max, we probably need to let you let you finish with this set of tires.\" and he said that's probably a little bit too much to ask. I think that's was his response. That's not the response of Max Fappen. Normally that's a bit more hey come on what are you I need you know like last year. Yeah. So so things are changing there and uh speaking to Lauren Mechis who is I mean that's his second race just before the the summer break. I mean it's definitely a big task uh for him but I think I think it can very much be be the right guy with the technical input if everyone in the team gives him even the support to to go forward because you can just see the other team uh finished actually in front Lawson in front of him and that's a team very much has been under the guidance of uh of Lauren Mechis which he passed on to Alan Perain and there's very interesting dynamics in in these things. But Max relaxed. He will have a summer holiday. He'll come back. Whenever he goes in a car, the car will go as fast as it can. And you're right about his overtakes. Yeah, the one he did on Gassley was brilliant. The placement of Gassley into turn two. Max firstappen. Here I come. Woof. He is a joy to watch even when he's further back the order, isn't he? He never gives up. He never gives up. Even if he is more relaxed on the radio. Guys, it's been wonderful to have you both on the show again. Thank you very much for your time. Now, we mentioned that Gabriel Bortalto was driver of the day on the telly. Can I have the driver of the day from each of you, please? Gabriel Baltto. That is, it's less than one year ago he had his first test in a Formula 1 car. So, uh I'm very proud to say uh the progress he has done has been fascinating to watch. speaking to Jonathan Weedley. Uh yeah, he's a pleasure to work with. Boroto driver of the day uh from here too. I agree with with the public on giving Bortoletto the driver of the day. Alonso also was was great. I mean, he I guess he maximized what what was possible with the Aston Martin, especially with uh starting the the weekend with this uh pain on his back and managing that uh throughout the weekend to to get the result in the end when the car clearly put an opportunity, but I also wanted to give Lando kudos for for coming back. Uh he tried it. He did his best and he he got a crucial victory. I mean to go on the summer break having just won the last Grand Prix before going on holidays. Okay, this this test before that. I guess that's the best way. Oscar was clearly frustrated. That will probably give him more fire to come back. Diego, I love your analysis, but you can't mention every driver as your driver of the day. I'm sure. No, I love your analysis, but can you pick one? Are you going with Borlet? because I can't give Lando the driver of the weekend, but I'm I'm going to leave him the I give him the driver of the day. Uh the weekend wasn't great because his qualifying wasn't perfect. He I expected him to be on pole. He was second row, but he he came back from being P5 on lap one to to win the race. So, yeah, I give him driver of the day. Okay. So, we've had one for Borletto, one for Lando Norris. I'm gonna give an honorable an honorable mention to George Russell. TK's looking at me, but actually my driver of the day is going to be Liam Lawson, who finished P8, having started P9. Um, he's a man who had such a rotten start to the year. He's fought his way back and I love what he's doing now. What is it? It's three points finishes in the last four races. Great job by him. So he is my driver of the day and I think that's that's why you're ahead of this podcast that you see that and I think that's uh well done on that. Beginning of the season he was 20th Max for at the front and now actually yeah he finished uh right in front of of Max. So yes he's uh he's back in the Red Bull limelight. Final thought as an aside, if Max Vstappen were in the racing bull, would he be closer to the McLarens than he is in the Red Bull? Who's There's only one man who can answer that and uh that's Lauren Mak. Exactly. Or maybe Yuki knows too because Yuki drove that car in the first two races and his best qualifyings I I guess have come in the racing bull at the beginning. I think we know what Yuki's answer to that is going to be. He can't say. He can't say. So, but what what are we going to talk about in the summer break now that Max has said he's he's staying? I'm I'm going to the beach. I don't know what you two are doing. Guys, thank you both very much for your time. It's wonderful to have you on the show. Enjoy the break and then uh we will come back before the Dutch Grand Prix at Xanvour for what is going to be a thrilling second half of the season.

      "[Music] This feels better than the real thing. [Applause] Excuse me. [Music] This has clearly become a race now. Hey, keep working. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] No. Yes. Yes. Last corner. [Applause] That was the the most fun driver sprint we've ever had. Um, some dirty driving from this one here. No, they they're filling the wall. Oh, yeah. The dirty boys are filling the wall right now. It was great fun. There's like a red flashing flag on a balcony into 10. It's really annoying. Looks identical to a red flag. We will report. [Music] Thank [Applause] you for that, Alex. Thank you to all three of you. Best of luck for the rest of the weekend. And we'll be back very shortly with part two. [Music] In comes Max Stappen. In comes Lando Norris. We are looking at the pit stop for the top two in the Grand Prix. I can't understand what McLaren are trying to do. It's close. It's close on the exit. Go to the first turn. It's side by side between the two rivals for the championship. He's got an expensive lawn mower. Yeah. Who were the drivers that you looked up to when you started? He loves Lewis Hamilton. Lewis Hamilton for you, Isaac. I know he loves Louis Hamilton because we did that fun. We did F1 together in Mexico and he was like, I'm going to wave to Louis when we when we drive. I want to wave at Louis. That's okay. We'll wave at him next time. He was sweating the day. We did a photo shoot. Like he saw Louis and he started then he gave the hand and he was sweating. Never shower again. Never shower. Has Louis spoken to you much? Has he given you advice for this season? Does he know how much you look up to him? I think he doesn't know this fans. He does now. He does now. Yeah. No way. Isaac Hajel. And he is gone into the wall. Okay. Is that going to get going? No. As soon as I saw what happened to to Isaac, my heart fell, you know, and I just felt for him. And uh it was it was just so sad to see because I know how hard it is when these kids are 8 years of age and they dream of becoming a Formula 1 race driver and there's a lot of pressure all the way up and you're sitting there on the grid for your first race and it doesn't happen and that's got to be the worst feeling in the world and I just felt for him and uh yeah I wanted to get to I just wanted to give him a hug you know I felt for him like a father. [Music] The middle sector is the best of anyone out there. 1 minute to go. Still a battle rages between the Ferraris and the McLaren. Will Lewis Hamilton go to the top? He will by 800s of a second. How about a world champion? Does he take it away from Lewis Hamilton? Oh, he misses out by less than 200s of a second. Where are we? That's Santiago. Really? Yeah. Good job, San Diego. San Diego. Mega job. Lando Norris once again sitting within DRS as a hard stop coming his way in a few meters time and a late defensive move from Charlotte. A lock up from Lando sends him deep. Oh, what a muffin. Oh no. Who's that? There's not a lot of room between the Ferrari and the McLaren, but Lando does it the long way round. Oh, you got it done. That was decent at least. Last lap. No. See, the best ever was in Monzo. He destroyed the car. [Applause] I destroyed the car. No. No. No. I destroyed the car. No. In case anyone didn't know, which the car is upside down. My real is like literally your head's this far from the wall. [Music] [Music] Nico Hulenberg 239 starts and a podium finisher in Formula 1 at long long last. I need it. What do you need for [Music] Max? Your thoughts? Wet race. Uh yeah, the slippery in the wet, so you have to uh take that into consideration. You see this garage of papaya suited McLaren employees standing out in the pit lane. They are all surrounding this car to prevent anyone taking close-up photos or really highquality film footage of all of this flow visualization die down the side of the car because they're desperate to stop other teams from seeing all of this information that giving away. You look at them all spilled out into the pit lane. However, we have really high quality cameras at this circuit. So, we've already got that information as well. This is fascinating stuff, isn't it, Julian? Yeah, it's our first look really at McLaren being the first garage as well this year on the back of being constructors champions last season. They pull into what has been Red Bull's slot for the last couple of years. So, when they do that human wall, no one nine teams up the up the pit lane now can see anything. We're used to seeing human walls. Oh, and they're stopping a photographer here as well. Quite literally physically. There are they are laughing stopping a photographer taking any photos here of that McLaren. I don't think I've seen that before in a pit lane at testing. Although I haven't been in the sport for that long. I don't know you guys have either. Track limits. Nice. Whoa. Oh, wa. That's That's a really good move. Yeah, it's terrible relationship. Yeah, we um we don't we don't get on anymore. Um it's taken its toll. Sounds tough. Yeah. Yeah. Big drama now. Yeah, big drama. We had a fight the other day in a local pub. Um we had to get escorted. Um, but I I always say, you know, you should have seen the other guy, but actually he still looks good. So, you know what happened?",
